Run the h2/run_h2_server.bat

Once the server is up successfully, the following information are printed on the console.
* TCP server running at tcp://10.65.16.158:9092
* Web Console server running at http://10.65.16.158:8999

Log in to the web console at http://localhost:8999/login.do
* Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
* JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/./testdb
* User Name: test
* Password: test
Once log in, we are successfully connected to a database called 'testdb'. There is a predefined table called COUNTRY.

The table and its data are created via the following SQL scripts
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS COUNTRY;
CREATE TABLE COUNTRY (CODE VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY, DESCRIPTION VARCHAR(255));
INSERT INTO COUNTRY VALUES('CN', 'China');
INSERT INTO COUNTRY VALUES('US', 'United States');
INSERT INTO COUNTRY VALUES('UK', 'United Kingdom');

If needed, copy the .h2.server.properties to c:\users\userID
